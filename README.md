# PCA and Elbow Method for Dimensionality Reduction
# Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, along with the use of the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of components to retain. By reducing the number of dimensions, we aim to simplify datasets while preserving the most important information for visualization and improving machine learning model efficiency.

# Features
# PCA Implementation: Learn how to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining maximum variance.
Explained Variance Visualization: Plot the cumulative explained variance to visualize how much information each principal component captures.
Elbow Method: Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of principal components for your model.
